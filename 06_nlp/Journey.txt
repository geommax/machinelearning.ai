Phase 2: Core NLP Concepts and Techniques
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Text Preprocessing
	- Tokenization
	- Stemming & Lemmatization 
	- Stop Word Removal
	- Handling special characters

Text Representation 
	- Bag-of-Words (BoW): 	
	- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
	- Word Embeddings - Word2Vec, GloVe
Classical NLP Tasks 
	- Text Classification 
	- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
	- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

Phase 3: Deep Learning and Transformers

moving to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants (LSTMs and GRUs) for sequential data.

The Transformer Revolution:
	- Attention Mechanism
	- Transformers and their key components (Encoder-Decoder architecture)
	- BERT models ( revolutionized transfer learning in NLP.)

Large Language Models (LLMs):
	- pre-trained LLMs
	- Learn Prompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning To adapt pre-trained models
	- Hugging Face's transformers library, which has become the standard for working with modern NLP models
